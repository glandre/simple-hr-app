# Project Architecture

## Overview

The project will be divided into two main applications: The Back-end RESTful API and the Front-end Single Page Application.

## Back-end

### Clean Architecture

The back-end code will be structured by following the [Clean Code Architecture (Robert C. Martin, 2012)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
**Notice:** Check if Laravel coding conventions may impact this structure.

## Front-end

### "Framework" of choice: React

Even though [React is not technically a framework](), it is a comprehensively library **definition here**, and its structure will drive the standards and conventions adopted in the front-end development, just like a framework would do.
