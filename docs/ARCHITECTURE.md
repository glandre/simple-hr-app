# Project Architecture

## Overview

The project will be divided into two main applications: The Back-end RESTful API and the Front-end Single Page Application.

## Back-end

### Laravel MVC Architecture

The back-end of this project is a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and adopts the [MVC architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), and respects the directory structure imposed by the Laravel Framework: https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/structure

### Data Layer

### API Documentation: Scribe

Compatible with Laravel 8

## Front-end

### Atomic Design

### "Framework" of choice: React

Even though [React is not technically a framework](), it is a comprehensively library **definition here**, and its structure will drive the standards and conventions adopted in the front-end development, just like a framework would do.
