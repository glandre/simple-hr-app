# Simple HR App

## Description

Simple HR App is a Web Application capable that allows the HR users to manage information about departments and associated employees with names and salaries.

Here are the main features available in this application:

- Manage (add, edit, list, delete) departments.
- Manage employees.
- Highest Salary per Department Report: Show all departments along with the highest salary within each department. A department with no employees shows 0 as the highest salary.
- List of Highly Payed Departments Report: List just those departments that have more than two employees that earn over 50k.

## Architecture

## Software Process

### Commits

Commit messages are important. In this project, a simplified version of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) method is followed. In summary:

- A commit message should have a Subject and optionally a body.
- A commit message Subject should be written in the imperative.
- A commit message Subject should be prefixed with a semantic word that clarifies its intent.

Semantic prefixes:

- `feat`: introduces a new feature to the codebase.
- `fix`: patches a bug in your codebase.
- `refactor`: introduces a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `docs`: updates the project documentation.
- `chore`: introduces changes in the maintenance of the codebase (e.g., build and deploy scripts).

### Versioning

This project follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) approach.
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
